      <h2>Intro</h2>

      <p>
        This week I kept reading the docs sequentially, but skipped the parts
        that I found basic or am familiar with. As I progressed through the
        docs, I found more and more interesting bits of information. So I
        decided not to jump around and keep with the sequential approach.
      </p>

      <h2>TIL #1</h2>

      <p>
        It turns out that like DOM, there is also CSSOM, or
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Object_Model"
          target="_blank"
        >
          CSS Object Model.
        </a>
      </p>

      <p>
        You probably used it without even knowing about it. For example, it's
        when you manipulate styles of a DOM element with JavaScript via it's
        <code>style</code> property.
      </p>

      <p>
        But, if you try to read values via <code>style</code>, you won't get any
        if they were defined with CSS. For this you can use the
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle"
          target="_blank"
          >window.getComputedStyle
        </a>
        method to get the actual styles of an element.
      </p>

      <h2>React render tree</h2>

      <p>
        You won't see any HTML tags in the tree because it is composed only of
        React components.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is indented behavior because React can be ran on multiple
        platforms, and the HTML tags could be some other platform specific
        primitives like <code>UIView</code> in iOS.
      </p>

      <h2>TIL #2</h2>

      <p>
        If you want to catch an event from a child, even if they stopped
        propagation, you can append <code>Capture</code> to the event handler.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/maxvrn/2d322020856e71fc2daca403a18f4a93.js"></script>

      <h2>TIL #3</h2>

      <p>
        You can use the
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inset"
          target="_blank"
          >inset</a
        >
        CSS property as a shorthand for
        <code>left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; top: 0;</code>
      </p>

      <h2>State</h2>

      <p>Changing local variables won't trigger a re-render.</p>

      <p>
        Hooks rely on stable call order, this is why you must follow the lint
        rules for hooks.
      </p>

      <p>In the following example, A and B will yield a different result</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/maxvrn/da3f80353d0c36c6d5416ac03e24c478.js"></script>

      <p>
        In A, the state will be incremented only by 1, but in B it will be
        incremented by 3.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is because in A, each call to <code>setCount</code> is using the
        current <code>count</code> value, so if <code>count === 0</code>, then
        each call will actually be <code>setCount(0 + 1)</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In B on the other hand, we ask from React the current state, so in the
        first call if <code>count === 0</code> we will get <code>c</code> as
        <code>0</code>, on the second call as <code>1</code> (because we already
        incremented it once) and so on.
      </p>

      <h2>Imperative vs Declarative</h2>

      <p>
        Entering a taxi and telling the driver where to turn on each
        intersection is imperative. Entering a taxi and telling the driver the
        destination is declarative.
      </p>
