      <h2>Intro</h2>

      <p>I want to deepen my knowledge in React.</p>

      <p>
        This week I started reading the docs, from the very beginning,
        sequentially. While the basic docs are great for beginners and they
        sparked some thoughts, I didn't get much value from reading them. Next
        week I'll go through parts that I want to improve my knowledge on or not
        familiar with.
      </p>

      <p>
        I will be posting my comments, thoughts and ideas that I wrote down
        about what I read, explored and played with.
      </p>

      <h2>React is mostly writing JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://react.dev/learn" target="_blank"
          >The Quick Start section</a
        >
        puts an emphasis on the fact that you use regular JavaScript inside
        React and JSX and includes a lot of reference links to
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">MDN</a> and
        other sources for learning JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, the fact that you can use ternary operators, mapping through a
        list to create a list of elements and in general escape from JSX into
        JavaScript by using curly braces, gives it a much closer feel to writing
        regular JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, it allows JSX to stay very minimal compared to other templating
        languages. It doesn't require any special directives like in Angular or
        Vue. Instead, plain JavaScript can be used.
      </p>

      <h2>State</h2>

      <p>
        Try to reduce state as much as possible. When possible, derive
        information from existing state. This reduces the moving parts in the
        component and makes it much easier to change, debug and understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you call the "set" function that is returned from
        <code>useState</code>, it tells React to start a re-render. This will
        cause the child components to re-render as well.
      </p>

      <h2>children type</h2>

      <p>
        Most of the places that talk about the recommended type for the
        <code>children</code> prop advice to use <code>React.ReactNode</code>.
        Generally, this is a good advice, but I personally prefer to use more
        strict typing and use <code>React.ReactElement</code> when possible. For
        example, when having a set of layout components which should get another
        element as <code>children</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another reason to why I prefer a more strict approach is because
        <code>React.ReactNode</code> allows <code>boolean</code>,
        <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>. If you don't have these
        allowed as children, you reduce the risk of passing them by mistake
        because of some conditional inside your JSX that might result in an
        unwanted result.
      </p>

      <h2>JSX</h2>

      <p>
        React must return a single wrapping element because under the hood JSX
        is being transformed into a JavaScript object. And because a React
        component is a function, and a function can't have multiple returns,
        React component can't return multiple JSX elements. Instead, it must
        have one tag or <code>Fragment</code> to wrap them all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because JSX is transformed to JavaScript, and in JavaScript we can't
        define variables with a hyphen or using reserved words, we can't use
        props with a hyphen or a reserved words like <code>class</code>. This is
        why we write <code>onClick</code> or <code>className</code>.
